# Uncommon HTML Bug: Element Existence and Script Timing

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to script execution timing in HTML. The script tries to access and modify an HTML element before the browser has fully parsed and rendered it, causing unexpected behavior or errors.

The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.html` demonstrates the solution.

## Bug Description
The script includes a function `myFunction` that aims to update the content of a div element with the id "myDiv".  However, if the script executes *before* the browser has finished parsing the HTML and creating the "myDiv" element, this function will fail, likely resulting in an error or unexpected behavior such as not changing the element content at all.
